# Fillit
My Fillit project for School21 by Sberbank

The task of the project is to write a program that will take a file containing tetramines. They need to be arranged in as small a square as possible. See file [sbj/04_fillit.en.pdf](https://github.com/TesenDesk/Fillit/blob/master/sbj/04_fillit.en.pdf) for more details.

This is the first group project at School21. It was done in collaboration with a student of the School, sgarry. He did the processing of the input data (the file), checking it for correctness and saving the resulting data inside the project. I was working on a solution search algorithm.
